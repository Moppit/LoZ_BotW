## DISCLAIMER: The premise of Legend of Zelda does not belong to me!
It is the property of Nintendo. This game is merely a parody, and it includes many elements that are typical of the game *Oregon Trail*. And, unlike the original game, this game is purely text-based.

>Considering that I could not save my own kingdom, I have no right to ask this of you, Link... But I am powerless here. You must save her... my daughter. And do whatever it takes to annihilate Ganon.

King of Hyrule, *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*

***Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*** is an amazing journey that takes you to every corner of the vast land of ruined Hyrule. If you are in the mood to play a rather long, mediocre, 
text-based version of such a masterpiece, here's how to get started.

## Instructions
If you have a C++ compiler on your computer, simply execute the a.out file in terminal.
If you do not have a C++ compiler, run the program using Repl.it, a free online IDE.

**The project is set up here and is ready for use**: https://repl.it/repls/IcyJoyousTypes

If that setup ever gets deleted, clone the master branch and upload the files in the unzipped folder to the Repl.it IDE.
Copy and paste the following script into the default main.cpp file, and click run.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  system("chmod 777 a.out");
  system("./a.out");
}
```
