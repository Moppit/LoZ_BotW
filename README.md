# LoZ_BotW
Text based version of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild mixed with Oregon Trail

## Instructions
If you have a C++ compiler on your computer, simply execute the a.out file in terminal.

If you do not have a C++ compiler, run the program using Repl.it, a free online IDE.

**The project is set up here and is ready for use**: https://repl.it/repls/IcyJoyousTypes

If that setup ever gets deleted, clone the master branch and upload the files in the unzipped folder to the Repl.it IDE.

Copy and paste the following script into the default main.cpp file, and click run.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  system("chmod 777 a.out");
  system("./a.out");
}
```
